The eye candy first.

One of the beliefs I hold dear to my heart, which remains true for me, is this: the love and security you recieve as
a child, will serve as an infinite source of strength in which you can draw from the rest of your life.  It forms
the foundation and belief system that your mind will unconsciously revert to in times of need - it forms your habits,
your tendencies and possibly part of your personality.

I have my own kids in which to test my theories out, they will be a work in progress till the day I die, in which I
hope to receive a stellar report card on my deathbed.  It is a volunteer responsibility that I take infinitely
seriously because I commited to it.

Part of what I realized works, is small constant reminders of touch stones and guidelines on how to behave - how or
what you should think when... it is neither black nor white.  Our world is colored in a million shades of gray, what
is the criteria in which to sort and navigate.  Within a week, I saw huge improvements in behavior.  Knowing what
their current challenges were, helped me refine the daily messages I put in their lunches.

I took it a bit further and designed cards, built upon the skills I learnt with building pipelines for AI generated
art, and etc.  The daily wisdoms, cannot be generated, they have to be curated from the classics and millenia of
human experiences and suffering.  The wordings, valid is so many perspectives and beautifully poetic, could occupy a
mind for an afternoon at school.  I hope they reflect upon all the possibilities of a daily message.

Quite a bit of ranting but there it is, not beautifully written because that is not a skill I have spent time
refining (rather, unfortunately) and not generative AI. ;)

Update: May 22, 2025.  I saw this facebook post online.  All signs are pointing towards a better future with just a
few notes.
