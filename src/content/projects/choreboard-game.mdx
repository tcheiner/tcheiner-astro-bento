[Rudimentary concept card set for A4](/images/projects/choreboardgame/completed-card-set-a4-combined.pdf), skipped
component studio and laid it out myself in illustrator.

I thought about, studied and referenced several games (Pokemon TCG, warhammer 40k cards, DnD cards, Everdell,
Everdell, Root, Modern Art) for various gaming strategies htat are fun, leaning more to the simplistic card design
so that the game board can be fairly small, mounted on the fridge and visually compelling for kids.  We can't have
too many meeples and also how to make it effective for each family and their unique needs.

Game design, I have not invested enough time in figuring out what happens here.  It is worth collaborating or hiring
a game designer to do this and finishing this.  I want to add a simple mathing component to this,
addition/subtraction/multiplication/division and game theory of min-maxing your points - different strategies per
season, different messaging.
