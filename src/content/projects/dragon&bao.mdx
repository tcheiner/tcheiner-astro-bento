Test Ecommerce site for Dragon & Bao. Reimplemented tags, breadcrumbs.

What am I doing here?  Seeing if there is a way to easily integrate an ecommerce solution into an astro site.  Why?
It requires a decent investment for any business whom wishes to do business online - the cost of moving money,
transactions, has been optimized to hell by Ayden, Stripe, Square, Mollie, Shopify and Paypal.  I looked at Notion,
Canva, Wix, Shopify for a quick and dirty solution and I find them all lacking in some way.  Most of which is that
it commits me to the platform, which is always a drag for a developer/architect.

Call it exploratory development.  I have started moving my recipes and such over from my blog to here, and this will
evolve organically.
