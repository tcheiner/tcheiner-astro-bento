Astro was what I settled on to get up and running quickly.
I find myself subscribing to the idea of doing what you love and doing it well - I do love what I am doing but decades
of professional work in software engineering and doing exactly (to a needlepoint precision) what a corporation requires
leaves little to develop inspiration to go freely where the mind wants to explore.

I needed an online presence and it quickly grew to a place I could put and document my work and life.  With the internet
so crowded and noisy these days, it is easy to get lost in it all, each with its pros and cons.  Contrary to what most
influencers and online personalities desire, I am relishing being lost and obscure.

Back to Astro, I love it.  I love the compartmentalization of thought and ability to evolve it to whatever you need to.
I love it more and more everytime I use it.  It is fast, easy to develop with.
It is also easy to hand off to someone else so they can simply use it to update the content.
