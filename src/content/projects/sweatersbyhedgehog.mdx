[SweatersByHedgeghog](https://hauntedoak.itch.io/sweaters-by-hedgehog) is a TTRPG game about a little hedgehog person
trying to sell their little sweaters in their little village shop.  This game is about recording a log of your most
interesting customers.  It is a game about the stories you tell and the people you meet.  It is a game about the things you do and the things you say.
It is a game about the things you make and the things you give away.

I implemented a straightforward port of the game [here](https://github.com/tcheiner/SweatersByHedgeHog) as a discord
bot, written in NodeJS with an api backend.

I rewrote/ported  it in python/fastapi/redis/docker [here](https://github.com/tcheiner/sweaters-fastapi) as a side
project. It is a work in progress.

I thought it would be the simplest little project to learn about discord implementations, and it is if you have
recently or regular implemented games but I do it once in a blue moon!  It was terribly fun, like all games are.  I
totally overlooked game state then managing users and etc.  Doh.  I did take an easy route and just implemented a
rudimentary version of it, assuming no multiplayer, games belong to a player and etc.

The longest time was designing the data model, and logging.  I like really in-depth and proper logging, from nmy
time at Wells Fargo, I realized that if you put effort in your systems (how things are to work and things like
infrastructure and logging), it opens doors to data -> insights -> informed decisions.  It also permits your dev
teams to pivot and move quickly, but you have to set the systems down and that does take the longest to gather the
data and design for.
