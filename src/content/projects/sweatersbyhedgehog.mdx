[SweatersByHedgeghog](https://hauntedoak.itch.io/sweaters-by-hedgehog) is a TTRPG game about a little hedgehog person
trying to sell their little sweaters in their little village shop.  This game is about recording a log of your most
interesting customers.  It is a game about the stories you tell and the people you meet.  It is a game about the things you do and the things you say.
It is a game about the things you make and the things you give away.

I implemented a straightforward port of the game [here](https://github.com/tcheiner/SweatersByHedgeHog) as a discord
bot, written in NodeJS with an api backend.

I rewrote/ported  it in python/fastapi/redis/docker [here](https://github.com/tcheiner/sweaters-fastapi) as a side
project. It is a work in progress.
