1. create a new /backend dir for python backend code for chatbot
2. create chatbot interface with react, typescript and css
3. install the following libs.  reminder to start using uv.

    ```bash
   pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu tiktoken python-dotenv
    ```

Will need to take a break to do soe research but continue this shortly, really working on a longer term process to
get all my data, preferably summarized and stored for chatbot to work with.  Preferably all automated because why
would I not.

The tech stack:
- Frontend: Astro + React + Typescript + CSS for the frontend chatbot interface
- Backend: FastAPI + RAG (FAISS + OpenAI embeddings + Langchain) for the backend chatbot logic deployed to AWS
Lambda containers
- Deployment: OpenTofu (formerly Terraform) to deploy the backend to AWS Lambda and API Gateway, Docker for containerization
- Security: AWS SSM for secure storage of API keys and environment variables, CORS protection, input validation,
content filtering

Future improvements:
- automatically rebuild vectorstores when new data (e.g., new blog posts) is added and deploy
- improve chatbot personality and responses with more context and fine-tuning
- add more data sources (e.g., GitHub repos, social media profiles) for a richer knowledge base
- implement user authentication and rate limiting to prevent abuse
- improve chatbot accuracy by continuously pausing and compressing (and building a graph db of knowledge) the
chatbot conversations (I am assuming short intro convos currently) -- inspired by AI Dev conference.

Update: Sept 2, 2025.
OH MY GOD!  This was harder than expected.  It worked locally within a day but to deploy it safely, I ran up against
limitation of AWS Lambda, Terraform (I decided to learn Terraform for this deployment because why not?), and Docker
and a whole slew of shell scripting for verification checks.  Terraform ceased to be the hot chick at prom while I
was working on it, so I picked up and migrated to OpenTofu for this leg of the development.

My Terraform script was set to:
- upload my zipped AWS lambda function (fastapi and mangum) to AWS S3,
- configure and deploy AWS API Gateway for a REST API
- configure and use AWS SSM
- set AWS IAM roles and policies attachment to run AWS Lambda
- configure AWS Cloudwatch

I have a Docker script to build the container, that I can deploy locally or via OpenTofu remotely using AWS ECR.

Funny story about AWS ECR.  I was being cheap and did not want to pay for AWS ECR so I had previously configured my
deployments to upload my REST API to AWS Lambda via a zipped file in AWS S3.  I was getting all sorts of weird
errors, and after a few hours, FIGURED OUT THAT AWS Lambda was importing my python dependencies in the function,
then loading the Lambda Layers (which had all my carefully optimized - for size - dependencies).  So I had
repeatedly gotten "Cannot find module" errors that spiraled into hours of checking my zipped files, checking my
terraform caches, AWS Lambda Layer hashes to ensure that the most recent zipped layers got uploaded ... infinitely.

So I gave in and created an AWS ECR repo, and pushed my docker container up to it.  It was a relief to see that it
just worked, reliably but not before I desperately and creatively lazy loaded my imports mid-code.  Yes, it was ugly.

After I got it ALL working, my chatbot sounded rather lame.  I do know I gave it more context that most generative
AI get in terms of data (all the content on this website with all my projects) so I spent the next few hours
tweaking temperatures and implementing (with the help of Claude Code) content filters (to keep to the point of
personality, cultural fit, professional topics) to prevent API key abuse, etc.  I figured it would help anyone
trying to assess if I could help them achieve their goals in any way, in no-commitment, exploratory setting.

We can definitely tweak it to be more personable but this is about the extent I am willing to take it today.

I had to do a security pass and move my api keys to AWS SSM, and then that spewed a whole series of properly
configuring AWS IAM to build and pull the creds properly.

This is typically what happens when I start on a project and have someone to chat with - I get ideas and refinements
that go on and on, I suppose.

In testing my new vectorstores for this post (update), I found inaccuracies in the chatbot responses.  Namely,
that my vectorstores are secured in AWS S3 and that it was a challenge (false on both counts!) but worth
exploring on whether it is a better approach.  It is not because all the vectorstore content is front-facing
anyway and it adds response time since it has to be downloaded from S3.  Claude  mentioned confidence scoring (which
is a great idea), so I am putting that in.  I am also putting in clickable links to my projects and posts, so people
can go navigate and read my literal words for accuracy.

In doing so, I know AWS Lambda functions have a size limit (and it is advisable to keep them small so they run fast),
so the utility functions are broken out into several files.

New file structure for code:

```
chatbot/
├── main.py          # FastAPI app + endpoints (259 lines)
├── filters.py       # Content filtering functions
├── sources.py       # URL conversion + clickable links
├── confidence.py    # Response confidence scoring
├── summarization.py # Skills-focused response summarization
├── services.py      # Vectorstore + QA chain management
├── models.py        # Pydantic schemas
└── routes.py        # Additional API routes
```

Had to update Terraform/OpenTofu to check hashes to update.  There is a lot of caching issues - but it makes sense
from a devops perspective to do so.

Checking responses and decided it was worth it to add a summarization pass on the response.

At this point, it is worth it to move these into Agentic workflows.  Stay tuned.
