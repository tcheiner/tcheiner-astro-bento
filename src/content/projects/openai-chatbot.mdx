1. create a new /backend dir for python backend code for chatbot
2. create chatbot interface with react, typescript and css
3. install the following libs.  reminder to start using uv.

    ```bash
   pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu tiktoken python-dotenv
    ```

Will need to take a break to do soe research but continue this shortly, really working on a longer term process to
get all my data, preferably summarized and stored for chatbot to work with.  Preferably all automated because why
would I not.
