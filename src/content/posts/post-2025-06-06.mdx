Here’s a detailed comparison table for various concurrency models, including examples, strengths, weaknesses, scalability,
resource usage, complexity, production readiness, and suitable architectures:
| ✅  | **Model**                 | **Examples**                                | **Strengths**                                                                 | **Weaknesses**                                                                 | **Best For**                           | **Scalability**   | **Resource Usage** | **Complexity**   | **Production Ready** | **Suitable Architectures**    |

| [ ] | **Pre-Fork**              | Gunicorn, Apache HTTP (prefork mode)        | - Reliable and predictable.<br />- Handles CPU-intensive workloads well.     | - High memory usage (one process per worker).<br />- Limited scalability for high concurrency. | CPU-intensive workloads.<br />Monolithic apps. | Moderate          | High               | Low              | Yes                   | Monolithic, legacy systems.  |

### **Key Takeaways:**
1. **Pre-Fork**: Best for monolithic, CPU-heavy apps where stability is key. Suitable for legacy systems.
2. **Thread-Based**: Works well for I/O-heavy workloads, but can struggle with race conditions in high concurrency.
3. **Event-Driven**: Ideal for lightweight, high-concurrency use cases like APIs and WebSockets. Common for serverless and microservices.
4. **Hybrid**: Balances the strengths of pre-fork and threading/async models. Good for mixed workloads.
5. **Single-Process**: Simple for development but not scalable for production.
6. **Multiplexing**: Great for moderate concurrency workloads with efficient resource usage, but requires careful tuning.
7. **Reactive**: Perfect for real-time, event-driven systems but requires expertise in reactive programming.
8. **Container-Based**: The go-to for modern architectures like microservices and serverless, with excellent scalability and isolation.
