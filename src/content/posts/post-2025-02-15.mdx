## Thoughts on Lab 08-14:
Went through these pretty fast, I already know most of it but will need to delve into the embeddings segment a bit more deeply.


## What's next
- hitting pause on this to process it and deviating to switch context and do some python programming with Advent of Code.  
- deviating also to delve into numpy and pandas.
