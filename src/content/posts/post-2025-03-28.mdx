Working with Adobe Illustrator to mock cards up.
I will use Component Studio to generate the rest.

The idea is to create a bunch of seasons of cards that kids can play with when the old ones get boring.
Chores are not the same for every age, every family, and every season!

The minimum age for these cards is when they start to read, whenever that is.
Each card has points. And, penalty points if not done within a period.  Another option is to roll a dice for
the reward.  The award points can either be graphed with the winner getting a prize at the end of the week, or
you travel around the board.

I will have to label this one, name the rooms and each room has a color that you get to visit if you hit the colored
stones around the board.  Based on the colors, you get to draw a reward.

I would like the prizes to be medals of sorts that the parents can buy for their kids.

Spent some time looking at a good ecommerce solution, I will try Shopify just because I am curious at how they built
out their apis and I am interested in hosting it in Netlify (totally in love with them and the easy deploys).

I spent an hour designing the cards for the first season and sorta gave up with Illustrator, I may have to modify the
art so it is easier to work with.

Here they are:
