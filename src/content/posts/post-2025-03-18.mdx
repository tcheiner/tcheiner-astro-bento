I wanted to to add a portion of my website for my favorite recipes so I have them in the event they get taken down,
or moved around during acquisition.  I referenced a few sites that I do like:
- nyt cooking
- bon appetite
- just one cookbook

Printable inspirations:
- pandacub chinese recipes

What is fascinating to me is the way information for a collection of recipes is massaged and diced per needs for the
general public.  What features would I need in my recipe collection?
- I sort by diet
- I sort by cooking duration or method
- I sort by main ingredients, cuisine and course of the meal
- I have different recipes for age groups
- I need to print my recipes sometimes

Breaking down the problem, let's just dump a few recipes in there that I am cooking this week and will reduce/categorize,
sort and, filter as we have the data.

Like all engineers, the biggest pain point is art and graphics.

This is how I typically scribble out my recipes when I cook:
![Scribble of how I do a recipe](/images/recipes/leftover-noodles-hand.png)

How would you do that in Node.js/css using whatever forms of technology out there?

I remember reading about DiagramsAsCode from ByteByteGo, what a perfect opportunity to try implement this!
![Architectural Diagram of a recipe](/images/recipes/leftover-noodles-quick.png)
I ended up using the Custom features to implement custom icons in place of what is available for systems components.
I wanted custom edges and cluster declarations as well, dug into the python code and did not find a quick way to extend
it.  Dug into the lib it extended, GraphViz, and it is probably possible there.

There is the code for the diagram:
```
<code>
# shortened for visibility by removing filepaths in
# original code.

from diagrams import Diagram, Cluster, Edge
from diagrams.custom import Custom

I pivoted and looked into how far pdf libs for code have come along (quite far) and it may be easier throwing together
an image in adobe, and along with css/html, export it to a pdf for a fancy printable version or straight text for home
printing.

Okay, tabling this.  I could go deep if I didn't have anything else going in my life.  Wil pick this up again as
inspiration strikes!
