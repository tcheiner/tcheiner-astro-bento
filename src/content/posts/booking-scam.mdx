Since 2023, a new kind of scam raised, scams in Booking.com internal chat system. In this article, I will share the experience happening to me, and the investigation result I found from the scamming website.

 People (like me) will expect, FB Message, Telegram, Twitter, or even Signal may get a scam message, since they just need your username or your phone number to contact you, and they are person to person, so strange individuals could be potential scammers. However, I trusted Booking.com internal chat this kind of internal chat system, because it is a business to person chatting system.

However I was wrong, and I feel myself was so stupid. On the day, I was rush to hang out, I got a message on booking.com from the hotel I booked, it says

> I need to put my credit card information in to reserve my booking, otherwise, they may not guarantee the booking will be kept.

This is very common for booking on Booking.com, but usually it happened before the payment, not after.

As a IT industry employee, I knew so many security practice, due to the rush and the trust to one brand, I leave all of them behind. Now I have **deleted my Booking.com account**, since the kind of scam has happened for about a year (see the news attached at bottom), and it is still happening.

Now let's see the investigation.


## What are wrong on the scamming website
### Scam From Europe / French / Algeria?

The default timezone, region and currency are in Europe/Algeria, the timezone is in Paris, but I was in Australia that time.

This credit card form looks legit, but it supports only Visa, even you put a master card, it will preview the credit card information on the top as Visa.

### Open my Firefox Inspector

After I suspend my credit card, and contacting the Hotel administrator.  I spent some of my time to investigate on the scamming website.


The Credit Card POST request will be posted to this url.  https://info.service-id427786413.shop/loading/644661616 (Do not click, even it has been shutdown now. )

However the response is a 503.

> I may be lucky here, that my credit card information was not posted to their server successfully, however, I couldn't take the risk, so I still suspend my credit card on the same day.


From the response we can find out the IP address.

The IP Address is  91.241.19.123. After a bit investigation, I found the IP was a known abuse IP. It was used for Cat Technologies, a company registered in Russia.  See more here about [the abuse IP result](https://www.abuseipdb.com/check/91.241.19.102).

And I can see the scam service is using PHP for the back-end from the inspector, which a very bad performance, fully load took about 4.7 seconds.

## Investigation Summary

There are many issues at this scamming website from the scamming message. I am not here to blame Booking.com did not do their cyber security well, but I just want to say how silly I was.

There are some obvious **red flags**.
- The URL, it is not under booking.com domain.
- Europe/ French / Algeria, I was in Australia, but the default country is Algeria, and the currency is Euro, the timezone is Paris Timezone.
- The credit card form supports VISA only, no proper business will accept Visa only for online payment.
- The chat bot UI is ugly and not functional



## Overall

Even with all these red flags, I still keyed in all my credit card information. However, what happened has happened, what I learnt from this journey is
1. Not trust internal chat system, hackers may hack it too.
2. Not rush to key your credit card information, give yourself a 10 seconds cool down time

### Tips to Prevent This to Happen
- Users
	- Check url before key in credit card.
	- Don't trust any website, even the one you trusted before, in this case, Booking.com.
	- Be patient, don't be scared by the languages in the message, such as
		- Please do this in 2 hours, or your booking may be cancelled.
- Booking.com
	- They should enforce 2FA to all stay owner.
	- They should have an end to end encrypted chat system.
