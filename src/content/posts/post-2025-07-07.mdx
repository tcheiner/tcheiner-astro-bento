I am bookmarking these two which look very promising for future development use:
- [baklavajs](https://github.com/newcat/baklavajs)
- [pyFlow](https://github.com/pedroCabrera/PyFlow/tree/master)

For agentic use:
- [Flowise](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise/tree/main) - the github install is broken
