Today is a good day.  I got up and felt great.  Sat down to work on the algorithm speed run and got it working in
5 minutes what my tired brain running on 3 hrs of sleep could not in 2 hrs last night.  A much-needed reminder that one
needs to stop when the progress is not markedly forward - one misconception that developers do nothing but play all day,
we are thinking all the time about the problems we are tackling.  I cannot speak for every developer/programmer but I
get bits of inspiration and ideas from real-life as well, sometimes running an errand!  It can be as simple as driving
out to pick something up and seeing algorithms implemented in traffic flows or store marketing and applying it or
filing it away for later use.  It is a literal recursive iteration of current existing frameworks in my mind.

I spent some time reading up MDX styling as well as I would like my posts to look a bit better other than braindumping.
