Did a bit more thinking on this last night.
Added colors to cards, they are applicable for points based on the following:
yellow: schoolday mornings
blue: schoolday evening
red: weekend/school break morning
gree: weekend/school break daytime

We have to do dishes everyday, so I added 5 wash dishes cards for the week and 2 for the weekend.
Based on what we need to do, I added cards for it.

But this ties the division of the entire hand to the week.
Also, how to add the element of healthy positive growing (awareness that things need to be done and it works so much
better as a team effort), and for minds that optimize the gaming elemnt of it, how to gear them to the right track?  It
feels like I am outwitting my family by implementing the rules per se.

Rudimentary game play, you go around the board based on the points you earn.  if you step on a colored stone, something
happens.  There will be opportunities to visit each "room" in the board and each room gives you certain advantages, much
alike Everdell.  Maybe you get to swap chore cards if you enter the "Common" room, or you can only swap "Kitchen/Cooking"
cards if you go into the kitchen room.  Anyway, I designed my board based on the above concept.

And, the rudimentary card set for A4, skipped component studio and laid it out myself in illustrator.

really have to suss out the game play.
