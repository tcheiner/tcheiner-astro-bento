Preeeeetty handy, I would say!

Started on a mockup on something I have been thinking of for a while - lunchnotes.
I wanted to design a trading card in the form of lunchnotes.  They have been effective in keeping the boys focused on
what we are teaching them at home.  Their attitudes are significantly different when you send a part of you to school
with them.  It feels almost like a no pressure reminder.  I am not sure if it is the effort to find the right quotes
and handwriting it, or if it is a note from me at school.  Regardless, this will be a good test.

I started with designing a cardback that represents our family, looked up the family crest and came up with this.

Then I did the front

Then I wondered if I should sell it as a digital good.
and started designing logos and such
