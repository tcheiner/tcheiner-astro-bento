Preeeeetty handy, I would say!

Started on a mockup on something I have been thinking of for a while - lunchnotes.
I wanted to design a trading card in the form of lunchnotes.  They have been effective in keeping the boys focused on
what we are teaching them at home.  Their attitudes are significantly different when you send a part of you to school
with them.  It feels almost like a no pressure reminder.  I am not sure if it is the effort to find the right quotes
and handwriting it, or if it is a note from me at school.  Regardless, this will be a good test.

I started with designing a cardback that represents our family, looked up the family crest and came up with this.

Then I did the front

Then I wondered if I should sell it as a digital good.
and started designing logos.

 All in all, there is still no one solution for ecommerce.  I also have a newfound respect for people who have started
their own ecommerce business!  It is a lot of work.
So far, I have used:
- coloors.co for a palette because I don't have a sense of color, really.  It is why I dress in neutrals.
- looka.com for some sense of a branding kit and logo
- canva for logos before I found looka.com
- shopify: really too much for a test ecommerce site, it is difficult to navigate (I can't find the close shop button
yet)
- kit.com - my favorite so far.  they provide a domain name and website and shop, everything you need in one place!
- the game crafter for card printing (realizing the cardback needs to be top/bottom reversible)

The space is definitely very crowded.  It makes me wonder how much more "stuff" do we all need?  It feels like one of
those circular death marches of the ants - this cycle of buying and tossing.

I found myself going through and looking at WarHammer cards, Pokemon cards and admiring all the design fetaures I have
learnt about card design.  More on that at a later date.
