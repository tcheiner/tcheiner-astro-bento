Need to do a quick write-up on what I have been working on.  I am writing more than writing code but, it condenses
the incremental knowledge better.


### FastAPI Work
- **Building APIs:** Developed high-performance, asynchronous RESTful APIs using FastAPI, leveraging its speed and simplicity.
- **Features:** Implemented core features such as request validation, dependency injection, and API documentation using FastAPI's
    built-in tools (e.g., OpenAPI and Swagger).
- **Backend Logic:** Designed and implemented backend business logic, integrating with databases, external APIs, or microservices.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Utilized Python’s async capabilities to create scalable, non-blocking endpoints.

### AWS Work
- **Infrastructure Setup:** Deployed applications using AWS services such as EC2, Lambda, or Elastic Beanstalk.
- **Storage:** Worked with S3 for object storage or DynamoDB/RDS for databases.
- **Serverless:** Used AWS Lambda for serverless computing, integrating with FastAPI through API Gateway.
- **CI/CD:** Set up deployment pipelines using AWS services like CodePipeline, CodeBuild, or tools like GitHub Actions.
- **Monitoring:** Monitored app performance and logs using CloudWatch or other monitoring tools.
- **Scalability:** Designed systems to scale using AWS tools like Auto Scaling Groups, Load Balancers, or container orchestration
    with ECS or EKS.

### General Development Practices
- **Security:** Implemented authentication and authorization (e.g., JWTs, OAuth2) and followed best practices for securing APIs.
- **Testing:** Wrote unit and integration tests for APIs to ensure reliability and robustness.
- **Optimization:** Optimized API performance and reduced latency by leveraging caching, query optimization, or AWS services like CloudFront.

#### Summary
I’ve been working on building high-performance APIs using FastAPI, focusing on scalability and asynchronous programming.
On the cloud side, I’ve been deploying and managing infrastructure on AWS, leveraging services like EC2, Lambda, and S3.
My work includes designing scalable architectures, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring the reliability and security
of the applications. Additionally, I’ve optimized API performance and implemented best practices for monitoring and testing.

Currently, I am adding Model Context Protocol (MCP) to my FastAPI project and test building out a technical
documentation website based on all of the above - quickly.
