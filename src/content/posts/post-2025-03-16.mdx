I downloaded a template and worked on it more, components I have added are:
- developing more components:
    1. one that as a daily quote of all the quotes I like (I collect quotes to sprinkle around
my community, the authors of old just always seemed to put these tibits of common sense in concise, graceful packages
that I rarely seem to be able to do on the fly)
    2. working on internationalization
    3. cooking recipe component
    4. book read component
    5. Now - what I am doing now component - I found this website talking about nownownow.com and loved it
- reading up on vercel, tailwind css, vue and svelte in order to write different components.

I am in love for quick, small projects that I deploy via Netlify.  It is much simpler than setting up a whole Github
Actions, AWS Amplify deploy.  And that is much easier than setting up a CI/CD Docker deploy.  But then, this is for a
piddly, personal project.
