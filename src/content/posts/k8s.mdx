title: "How to make Kubernetes Cluster Hybrid to cross Private Subnet and Public Subnet"
description: "It is very easy to have scalability when all nodes are in Public Subnet, so all nodes will have Public IP and to connect different nodes from different cloud provider easily. Why it is not ideal to make all K8s nodes public? The reason is security concern, especially for self managed k8s cluster(like what I did)."
