Tmux on macos is so different than tmux on windows.  I don't think I can go back to windows.

I ended up installing TPM (tmux plugin manager) via https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm#installation

Okay, need to admit this is more in-depth than I wanted to go into, so tabling it for now.

I need one of these up on my whiteboard: https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/

I am running so many things when I do dev these days, I am sure it could be further optimized but not sure how.  It
always ends up this way - an editor, a few terminals, a browser with a shit ton of reading and ideas churning in my
head, testing tools, now AI chatbots of various types in various forms, communication apps, email... HOW DOES ONE
MAKE AN MACBOOK AIR work?!?  Thankfully, I do not have one but loving my debian based macbook.  Jon is in his office
gritting his teeth with his Windows machine.  Haha.
