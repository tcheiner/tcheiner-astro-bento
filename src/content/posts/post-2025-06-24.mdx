[Terraform AWS Tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws/lambda-api-gateway)
After a whole day of banging at it, I found a tutorial from Terraform that worked.  I think etags are the key.

Again, I believe the key is file structure and how you organize your code to make it intuitive.
The following list of terraform files and they implied structure is what I used to get it working:
1. terraform.tf     : declare terraform{} here, along with version, required providers.
2. variables.tf     : declare your variables here, along with their types and defaults.
3. main.tf          : declare your resources here, along with their types and properties.
4. outputs.tf       : declare your console outputs here, along with their types and values.
 ```terraform
 ```
