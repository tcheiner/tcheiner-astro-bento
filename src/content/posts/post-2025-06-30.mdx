## Shopping Spree list:
- [AgentGPT](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT)
- [privateGPT](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt)
- [Flowise](https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise)
- [sql translator](https://github.com/whoiskatrin/sql-translator)
    - oh fucking hell.  you feed a prompt into gpt to get a sql statement.   that is an absolute waste of resources
  to cool, power those chips.  the code is 40 lines long for crying out loud.  in not-a-real-programming-language.
- [RestGPT](https://github.com/Yifan-Song793/RestGPT) based on [Cornell Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06624)
    - not quite sure why this is a big deal, I assumed this is what everyone is doing in regards with the rise of
  Agentic AI and MCP.  In fact, this is what we designed for deployment when we developed the design for the
  platform that Manaburn would run on a year ago.  The planner is not much more than a GPT call with a guided answer,
  it is limited to the narrow examples given in the paper by Cornell, and I certainly would not put it in production
  for anything more than a plaything.
    - it isn't a good use of LLM or any large language models, because it is not the worth the energy expenditure to
  skip the actually coding to route the API calls to the right places.  OMG, idiots.  I question the validity of the
  source of my shopping spree list.
    - it was written in 2023, probably a big deal then but not now.
- [ChatFile](https://github.com/guangzhengli/ChatFiles)
- [MindsDB](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb)
  querying a document - using LLM.  very handy.
- [Animated Drawings](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AnimatedDrawings)
- [Background Remover](https://github.com/nadermx/backgroundremover)
   - i will actually use this tool.
- [LobeChat](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat)
- [MicroAgents](https://github.com/aymenfurter/microagents)
- [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands)
- [FlowGPT](https://github.com/nilooy/flowgpt)
- [Medimind](https://www.openxcell.com/ai-chatbot-healthcare/)

I need a break.  It's trying to understand a raccoon on meth.
I have to believe the average person is really not that bright.  I am sorry.
