# My First Blog Post

I wanted a dev journal, per se, to keep track of my learning and progress.  There is so much material out there that I lose track of what I have done.  I did not want the overhead of one more login on Blogger/WordPress with the ads and pricing structure - simple is best!  

So, I looked around on Github to see if there was a way to simply host a blogging framework on Github and deploy it via Netlify and no surprise, there was!

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.  It works with React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Documenting steps for a straightforward &lt;a href="https://astro.build/"&gt;Astro&lt;/a&gt; build! 

## What I like:
1. **Component Based**: It works well organizationally for content.  It is straightforward and simple to organize.  It is well-designed for graceful code layouts.  The framework makes it easy to understand as well.
2. **Easy dynamic routing**: Almost effortless.  Easiest way to dynamically generate pages, imagine all error and 404 errors are handled by default, out of box!
3. **Uses the most common frontend frameworks**: Makes migration of current website fairly quick.  There is little to relearn and enables quick adaptability.
4. **Solid online documentation and tutorial**: I had no issues till Unit 5.  It is updated. Taking about 3 hrs to cut through 5 units of the tutorial.

## What I've accomplished
1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new &lt;a href="https://astro.build/"&gt;Astro&lt;/a&gt;  project and set up my online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have &lt;a href="https://astro.build/"&gt;Astro&lt;/a&gt;  pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next
I will finish the &lt;a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial" &gt; Astro &lt;/a&gt; tutorial, and then keep adding more posts.

## Documented Steps:
1\. Install Astro in a directory of your choice locally, select yes for Git integration
	&lt;code&gt;npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal&lt;/code&gt;
2\. Run the following in terminal&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;cd blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;npm run dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;astro telemetry disable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
3\. Test website via:  &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:4321/ &lt;/code&gt;
4\. Set up your &lt;a href="https://app.netlify.com/login"&gt;Netlify &lt;/a&gt; account if you do not have one
5\. Debug and fix tags not filtering and displaying properly
6\. Added formatted dates to tag filtering and blog posts.
