I took a break and coded up a hospital REST API (simulated) for clinical trials, trying out the new vibe coding
kings and queens of modern day tech: Lovable and Base44, flirted with a mental wellness startup for a few months,
got involved in two other startups that I am pretty excited about and took on a few job interviews.  I've gotten a
lot better at pivoting fast for prototype demos that startups need, it usually takes between 1-2 days for a UI
prototype and a few weeks for something more complicated.  What takes me the longest in that process is still a CI?
CD infrastructure setup.  There is always something to work on, how that companies have matured and devops is now a
field of its own, it is almost impossible to be cutting edge for all three fronts: frontend, backend, and deploys.
Except with the use of AI-Assisted development tools, I am surprised that more accurate MCP documentation servers
are not more available to give LLMs more context to work with.  There is quite a bit out there but I have yet to
find the "notification list" for what is being rolled out weekly/monthly.  Like all things, we need a registry for
everyone.

I also spent some time looking at some of the vibe coding websites, i could really use some scaffolding tool for ui
for my projects, I broke that set of ramblings off to a different post.

I found Supabase and used their free tier - it is not advertised anywhere as a free db that is ideal for prototyping
in the cloud ecosystem.

Got an offer at one and we are negotiating the comp right now - not yet confirmed.  We were going to move back to
the US this summer but the cards said no.  Every American we talked to said that the US is not a great place to be
right now.

Attended the AI Dev conference last week hosted by the Linux Foundation and am inspired!  I love the Linux Foundation!
The best talks and workshops that I have attended, it was just really meaty with real content instead of fluff.  I am
inspired enough to pick up my chatbot implementation and finish it today.

What I am doing next:
- journaling chatbot lessons learned before I forget them.
- replicating a facial recognition model that I saw in AI Dev to recognize sarcasm - video and text.
- replicating a demo that I saw in AI Dev to use Docker Hub to deploy agents.
