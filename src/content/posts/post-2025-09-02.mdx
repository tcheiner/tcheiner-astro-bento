## Introduction
I took a bit of a break, summer is a bit of a busy time, schedules are a bit up in the air.

## Main Content
I took a break and coded up a hospital REST API (simulated) for clinical trials, trying out the new vibe coding
kings and queens of modern day tech: Lovable and Base44, flirted with a mental wellness startup for a few months,
got picked up by two other startups that I am pretty excited about and took on a few job interviews.  Got an offer
at one and we are negotiating the comp right now - not yet confirmed.  We were going to move back to the US this
summer but the cards said no.  Every American we talked to said that the US is not a great place to be right now.

Attended the AI Dev conference last week hosted by the Linux Foundation and am inspired!  I love the Linux Foundation!
The best talks and workshops that I have attended, it was just really meaty with real content instead of fluff.  I am
inspired enough to pick up my chatbot implementation and finish it today.

What I am doing next:
- journaling chatbot lessons learned before I forget them.
- replicating a facial recognition model that I saw in AI Dev to recognize sarcasm - video and text.
- replicating a demo that I saw in AI Dev to use Docker Hub to deploy agents.
