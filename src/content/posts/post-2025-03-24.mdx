Second pass of my chore board game.  It takes a while and finally settled on using illustrator, probably a bit heavy handed.

Took a pass at the cards as well, I will need to generate some landscapes.

And the cardfront.

How would gameplay work?
It should start simple - and the simplest I can come up with is the following.
Maybe draw cards for chores, and everytime a chore is complete, you roll a dice to move forward around the track.
Every time you move around the track,  you can go up a level.  Every time you go up a level, you can pick a location
card for your character to visit - Starhaven Keep, Aetral, Sunstone, Celestial, Vyntbar, Stonewatch, Starfall Wharf,
Enigma Keep, Driemolith, Moonbeamm Oakentbrone, Grimsteel.  Some of these areas will be slowly developed, so please be
patient.
Every time you reach a blue level, you can draw a blue wish card for a real-life reward.
Every time you reach a gold level, you can draw a gold wish card for a real-life reward.
