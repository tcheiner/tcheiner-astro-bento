Eversince I found Astro, and fell in love with Astro, I've inevitably fallen in love with markdown.  It is an
efficient way to write and document.  It doesn't feel as resource intensive as jupyter notebook, or Notion, which
eventually requires a reboot.  Modern apps, as much as they provide, feels like there is so much of a time crunch
getting them published that there is little consideration for the resources they use, how they clean up and garbage
collect.  Anyway, moving on.

I had to try Zeetlr when I stumbled across it on the web.  Markdown notes, I love it.  It looks like I am jump in
and contribute to the open source as well.

Quick update- 06-19-2025:
Still finding Zeetlr irreplaceable for working with markdown, which I believe will be popular in the near future.
But it crashes a lot, which is exceedingly annoying.  There is a lot of low-quality apps and development out there
that lets their memory consumption go unhinged and unmonitored.  One big offender for me is Google Chrome, they have
the best engineers and the most difficult tests and yet I am finding that more and more of these
go-fast-iterate-fast models do not critically think.  They dig up and repackage old software methodologies as "new"
and "revolutionary" and yet, it is the same old stuff with a newer cellophane packaging, with a new layer of
abstraction, that is more memory or resource consumptive.  Pet peeve - if you are creating and putting something out
there, make it better (really, better) and not because you are desperate to win some popularity contest, meet some
random MBA business defined metric.
