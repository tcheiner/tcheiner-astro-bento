I got the kids home last week and they were going on and on about - riceballs.

Apparently, their riceball lunches have been a topic of viral discussion at school.

The traditional riceball lunch is known as "onigiri" in Japan.  It is a dutch sandwich,
but with rice instead of bread and wrapped in seaweed.  Instead of the typical deli meat,
you have flavored proteins and sliced veggies in them.  It is triangular or round in shape,
and typically shaped by hand.  The rice is sticky and seasoned with vinegar, salt, and sugar.

I used to skip this seasoning until I realized that it serves three purposes: adds salt when
you are out and active (riceballs are a great traveling, on-the-go, hiking food that
also inspires great envy), it also preserves the rice since rice is high in starches and
the perfect starting point for ferments of all sorts (including kimchi!) and lastly, the
vinegar serves as a "glue" to keep your riceball together, conquering random slices and bits
of vegetables I try to cram in for extra nutrition.

In 1985, a manga was released ["Cooking Papa"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_Papa)
and it is about a working dad (whose wife does not and cannot cook) who secretly loves to
cook.  I started reading it because I was looking for a fun way to teach lifeskills to
my boys (and they all love comics - its an easy first reader).  The creator of the manga,
Tochi Ueyama, created a new form of a riceball called "onigirazu".  I started seeing
pictures of onigirazu in Kinokuniya and I was like "what is this?!"  It is a riceball but
substantial enough to not carb crash and I can level out the proteins in it better!!!

Mark (of Portland, Oregon), longtime fan of [JOC](https://www.justonecookbook.com/about/)
prototyped the first (that I have known of) onigirazu mold made of traditional woods that
riceball tools are made of (they permit the water vapors from rice to dissipate slowly
without reintroducing the moisture back into rice, making it soggy) sent her a mold as a
gift and... onigirazu is a bit more popular in modern day.

I do love riceballs.  I love rice.

Moving on from that tangent, I thought (hahaha! how many times has a tinkerer thought
that) I could quickly throw up an ecommerce site for any kid who wants an extra riceball
for lunch and two days later..., here it is: (dragon & bao)[https://dragonandbao.netlify.app/]

I have poor color theory sense, so I used [Looka](https://looka.com/) to quickly come up
with a branding rough draft/idea/feel, I used [Coloors](https://coolors.co/) to generate
a few color palettes, I used [uicolors](https://uicolors.app/) to generate shades
(matching hues) for an extended palette, I used Obsidian to track notes (and refer to
old notes) of what I was doing.  All free, if you know when to stop and pivot.

I also have an all encompassing subscription to Adobe currently (which I am absolutely
loving because it takes care of all my graphics needs - I learnt Photoshop a couple of
years back so I am able to navigate it fairly easily, Adobe Firefly generates everything
else I need).

I get the rough draft, set up the file structure the way I like it, and because I am no
frontend expert, I have [aider](https://aider.chat/) run through and tweak any of the
UI stuff I want tweaked without getting knee deep in css styling.  I end up spending a
night refactoring aider's code (and it is supposed to be the best when paired with Claude),
because the codebase ended up looking like an absolute rat's nest.  Again, for all you
vibe coders out there, for all the companies thinking they don't need developers, you
are not there yet.  I love pair programming with AI, it is life changing but I think I
use it differently than a junior developer or a business person.  Is it worth the
electrical, water/cooling costs?  No, it is not worth it as a learning tool or even
motivational tool.  But I suspect it is how progress in made, technology advances and
optimizations achieved.  You start with brute force and it is ugly, and exceedingly
expensive because it is the way we learn.  Literally, with pain.

Enough waxing poetic.  I checked it into [Github](https://github.com/) and connected my
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to that new repo and it deploys.  Counting on low
views and Netlify to stop the web crawlers/harvesters and the fact that I don't
advertise so I don't have to pay for views and I do document my work/progress.

Could this be done via AWS Amplify using Github Actions?  Yep.  But I don't need a big
setup, this is at best a POC/MVP.  There isn't much traffic and it may not go live.

I spend so much time with this UI stuff to show the backend stuff, because backend is not
showy nor sexy.  The UI is work for me, and sometimes it is a lot of work for a small
backend concept or a big backend concept.  It is cogs and parts working together for a
perfectly synchronized, harmonious, domino effect of what is essentially data moving
and transitioning from one purpose to another.  It is exhilarating when it works...
perfectly.  I love AI for being my UI crutch but a lot of my stuff will look more UI
because I need it to get to the backend stuff.

The backend stuff, is what I love.
