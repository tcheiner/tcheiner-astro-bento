List of things to check out today:
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Gobii](https://gobii.com/)
- [Nylas API](https://www.nylas.com/)
- [RA-Aid](https://ra-aid.com/)

## Heroku
Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It supports several programming languages and is known for its simplicity and ease of use.
    ```bash
    brew install heroku/brew/heroku
    heroku login
    cd <appropriate dir>
    heroku create
    ```
stopped because it required a credit card.  the cost is minimal but i really can't have my floating cc # in every
different service. there will be too many floaters to manage.

## Vercel
I can already tell Vercel is Node.js only.  some form of UI language.
Rounding back to it later but moving on now.

## Nylas API
Nylas is a developer platform that provides APIs to integrate email, calendar, and contact functionality
into applications. It simplifies the process of building features related to communication, scheduling,
and contact management by abstracting the complexities of working with different email, calendar, and
contact providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, etc.)

It does what it says, it took me 5 min (including sign up) to do exactly that!
It is great if a platform needs email or calendaring features.

#### Alternatives to Nylas
- Microsoft Graph API: For Microsoft-specific integrations (Outlook, Office 365).
- Google Workspace API: For Google-specific integrations (Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.).
- Twilio SendGrid: For email sending and marketing automation.
- Calendly API: For scheduling and calendar integrations.

## Gobii
Browser automation tool that you can integrate via API instead of scripts.  It is a development
friendly version of Selenium.

Taking a break, so much noise out there that it is overwhelming.

There is clearly an encampment of developers that string together provider service one after
another to create a new service.  My initial thought that it doesn't inherently build value in
your product.  If your product/service blows up, after you did the work marketing and finding
use cases for it, the bar if entry is low to compete.  I don't know everything but perhaps
this is the trend of things to come.  It waters down the value of what everyone has.

More importantly, why would you share and give up your data for speed when data is the new currency?

I do know that it creates a lot of noise, it trashes a developer's mind and habits to not consider
the problem at hand and just solve that but habitually string the most 'fashionable' services together.
I am not sure what to think, will have to marinate on this.
