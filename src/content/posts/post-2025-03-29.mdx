I have enough cards now.

Areas of improvement:
- names of characters for early vs advanced vs adult readers should be different: learning vowels, cutesy, teen cool
and adult trending cool flavors.
- tasks descriptions should reflect the above flavors as well
- one thought is to release packs that start with chores as kids grow, as well as an adult pack for roomie situations
- one thought is also to release packs that help establish habits we want to learn - collabs with Brene Brown, healthy
mental and emotional frameworks
- point system should following the following competencies: addition/subtraction, multiplication/division,
exponential/logarithmic

I need to make a table of chores divided by the following categories:
- schoolday morning: yellow
- schoolday evening: blue
- weekend/holiday morning: red
- weekend/holiday day: green

These are when you draw from these specific decks.

I created two more boards because they are fun to do:
