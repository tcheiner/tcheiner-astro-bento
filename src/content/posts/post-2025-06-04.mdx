# FastAPI Implementation with Docker, Async Refactoring, and Gunicorn

Had to write a FastAPI implementation for a project, using Python.
They wanted to know what it would look like to have a **Docker Deploy**, then **IaC in Cloud Deploy**.

I documented it all [here](https://mt-app.netlify.app) â€“ trying out an Astro documentation framework and I love it.
I am addicted.

I am in the middle of **refactoring code so it works with async (concurrency)** and tossing in **Gunicorn** in the mix.

## Threadpool Basics

### What is a Threadpool?

- A threadpool is a collection of **pre-created threads** that can be reused to execute tasks concurrently.
- Instead of creating a new thread for every task (which is expensive), threads are reused from the pool, which improves efficiency.

### Why Does FastAPI Use a Threadpool?

- FastAPI uses an asynchronous event loop (via `asyncio`) to handle requests.
- If you use a **synchronous function (`def`)** in a path operation or dependency, it could block the event loop while performing its operation. This would prevent other requests from being handled concurrently.
- To avoid blocking the event loop, FastAPI runs synchronous functions in a **separate threadpool**.
  This allows other tasks in the event loop to continue running while the synchronous function executes in a separate thread.

### How Does FastAPI Handle `def` Functions?

- When you declare a path operation or dependency as a synchronous `def` function:
  - FastAPI detects that the function is synchronous.
  - It runs the function in a threadpool using Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` (via `asyncio.to_thread` or similar mechanisms).
  - The result of the function is **awaited** by the event loop, so the response is returned to the client once the function finishes execution.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

1\. When a request is made to a path operation with a `def` function:
   - FastAPI submits the function to the threadpool for execution.
   - The threadpool executes the function in a separate thread.
2\. The main event loop **awaits** the result of the function, allowing other requests to be processed in the meantime.
3\. Once the function completes, its result is returned to the event loop, which sends the response back to the client.

### Dependencies in a Threadpool

- The same logic applies to dependencies declared as `def` functions.
  FastAPI runs them in the threadpool to avoid blocking the event loop.

---

## How Threadpools Work in FastAPI

### Asynchronous Functions (`async def`):
- Asynchronous functions do **not** use a threadpool.
- They run directly on the **event loop**, which is managed by `asyncio`.
- These functions are **non-blocking** and can yield control back to the event loop when performing I/O or awaiting tasks, allowing other requests to be processed concurrently.

### Synchronous Functions (`def`):
- Synchronous functions **do** use a threadpool.
- FastAPI runs these functions in a threadpool to prevent them from blocking the event loop.
- Specifically, FastAPI uses the **default threadpool** provided by Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.
  This threadpool is shared across all synchronous tasks submitted to it.

### Single Threadpool for Synchronous Tasks:
- All synchronous (`def`) functions executed by FastAPI share the **same threadpool**.
  There is no separate threadpool for each function or path operation.
- The threadpool's size (number of threads) is usually determined by Python's default configuration (based on the number of CPU cores), but it can be customized if needed.

### No Threadpool for Asynchronous Tasks:
- Asynchronous (`async def`) functions are handled **directly by the asyncio event loop**, not by a threadpool.

---

### Key Takeaways:
1\. FastAPI uses **one shared threadpool** for all synchronous (`def`) functions.
2\. Asynchronous (`async def`) functions bypass the threadpool entirely and run directly on the asyncio event loop.
3\. Synchronous and asynchronous code does **not** have separate threadpools because asynchronous code does not use threadpools at all.

---

## When to Use Synchronous Database Code

### Use Case:
- Use synchronous database code (in a `def` function) if the database library or driver you are using does **not** support asynchronous operations.

#### Example: Synchronous Database Code with `psycopg2`
- `psycopg2` (a popular PostgreSQL driver) is **synchronous** and does not natively support asynchronous calls.
- Synchronous database operations will block the thread they are running on.
  FastAPI will handle this by running the code in a **threadpool** to avoid blocking the asyncio event loop.

    ```python
    import psycopg2
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    def get_data_from_db():
        connection = psycopg2.connect("dbname=test user=postgres password=secret")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM some_table")
        result = cursor.fetchall()
        connection.close()
        return result

    @app.get("/data")
    def read_data():
        data = get_data_from_db()
        return {"data": data}
    ```

In this example:
- The database call is **blocking**.
- `get_data_from_db()` will be run in a threadpool to avoid blocking the event loop.

---

## When to Use Asynchronous Database Code

### Use Case:
- Use asynchronous database code (in an `async def` function) if the database library or driver you are using **supports asynchronous operations**.

#### Example: Asynchronous Database Code with `asyncpg`

    ```python
    import asyncpg
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.on_event("startup")
    async def startup():
        app.state.db = await asyncpg.create_pool(dsn="postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname")

    @app.on_event("shutdown")
    async def shutdown():
        await app.state.db.close()

    @app.get("/data")
    async def read_data():
        async with app.state.db.acquire() as connection:
            result = await connection.fetch("SELECT * FROM some_table")
        return {"data": [dict(row) for row in result]}
    ```

In this example:
- The database call is **non-blocking**.
- The `asyncpg` library is used to make **asynchronous** queries to the database.

---

### Asynchronous Transactions with `asyncpg`

You do **not** need to manually implement transactions (like `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, etc.) as blocking code when using `asyncpg`.
The `asyncpg` library fully supports **asynchronous execution** of all types of database operations, including transactions.

#### Example: Asynchronous Transactions with `asyncpg`

    ```python
    import asyncpg
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.on_event("startup")
    async def startup():
        app.state.db = await asyncpg.create_pool(dsn="postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname")

    @app.on_event("shutdown")
    async def shutdown():
        await app.state.db.close()

    @app.post("/update-data")
    async def update_data():
        async with app.state.db.acquire() as connection:
            async with connection.transaction():
                await connection.execute("UPDATE some_table SET column1 = $1 WHERE id = $2", "new_value", 1)
                await connection.execute("DELETE FROM some_table WHERE id = $1", 2)
        return {"message": "Transaction completed"}
    ```

## Gunicorn with Async FastAPI and Database Connectivity

### Gunicorn Workers
- Gunicorn by itself is **not asynchronous**.
It spawns **multiple worker processes** to handle concurrent requests.
- To support FastAPI's async capabilities, use an **async worker class** like `uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`.

#### Example Gunicorn Command:

    ```bash
    gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker app:app
    ```

Here:
- `-w 4`: Spawns 4 worker processes.
- `-k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`: Uses Uvicorn's async worker class.

---

### Database Connection Pooling with Gunicorn

#### Connection Pool Size:
- Each Gunicorn worker will have **its own process** and **its own database connection pool**.
- Ensure your database has enough capacity to handle the combined connections across all workers.

---

### Key Takeaways:
1\. Gunicorn workers run **separate processes**, each with its own database pool.
2\. Use load-testing tools (e.g., `locust`, `wrk`) to monitor worker and database performance.
