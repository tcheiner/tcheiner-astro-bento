Loveable vs Bse44, definitely Base 44 each time, it is a bit more solid.  It took a full day upon
download to convert it properly to code that would work locally, and then to add to that.  It is heavily reliant on
their own sdk.  Loveable has a different UI layout foundation, sometimes it can give you a better UI but moving it
off Loveable was a pain or not permitted as I did not do it for one reason or another.  The colors used are.. oh,
terrible, beyond terrible.  I don't know why anyone would waste tokens trying to get that right.

It is typical colors but I use Material Design themes all the time, I am getting more with it but I don't have an
eye for color and palettes and am too cheap to pay for one.  I get a few freebies at Coolors but again, a lot of
work trying to get together a whole palette.

I tried Dreamflow recently as well.  For flutter developers.  It gives a decent scaffolding, design doesn't blow me
away, colors are bad.  I have not tried downloading and converting it yet - it takes some doing, I imagine.

why I love it, it is a great source of scaffolding for a backend based engineer.  I can definitely tweak existing UI
but to come up with one is inherently time consuming.  There are standards to lay a mobile app or web app as it
adheres to usage patterns and thus recommended design patterns.  They are blogged, they are spoken off, Android does
the best job of explaining it via Material Design but again, it changes quickly enough that I am not always kept up
on the latest.

The magic behind  these vibe coding platforms is that they are based off a very standard, uncreative basis,
supported by a custom sdk that glues all these pieces together, possibly provides some ground rules on how
responsive, navigation, backend design is to be handled.  We have not reached teleporter status where everyhing is
absolutely magical, and that we can have everything we want.
