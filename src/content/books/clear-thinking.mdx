I ran across a Shane Parrish interview not too long ago and what he said really spoke to me.
He offers a framework to organize and structure your life so that you can make some quick
decisions and get some structure and clarity in a rather simplistic, common-sensical way.

Whilst it is not anything new or world changing in particular, it did bring me back to and
reminded me of a lot of touchstones I used to have that did work.  It is a perspective that
does work.
