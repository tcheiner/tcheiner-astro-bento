I read a lot everyday, a lot of news a tech reporting to keep abreast of what is new and going on.  It took me about
two years to find everything I think I need to have a thread on the pulse of things.

Found an article from Ted Neward this morning on Tech Debt rather articulately written- https://blogs.newardassociates.com/blog/2025/debts-tech-and-otherwise.html
