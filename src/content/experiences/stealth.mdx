Working with 2 stealth startup founders to build out two startups:
1. A prediction engine for technology trends: can't say too much more but they have the tech, they have the math,
they have the technical chops.  They could use some direction with the solution architecture, deployments, UI, a mop
it up type of person.  That is where I come in to chip in.
2. A brand built from ground up, with a community focus.  They have a great idea, and a great team with royalty
level genetics, they need someone to drive product and make it happen.  I am the 3rd co-founder.  More deets to come!
