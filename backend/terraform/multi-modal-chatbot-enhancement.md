---

## Multi-Modal Knowledge Sources

### 1. Code + Explanation Pairs (GitHub)
Extract technical reasoning from your existing projects:

```python
# Implementation: Add to content_ingest.py
def extract_github_knowledge():
    """Extract code commits with meaningful commit messages"""
    sources = {
        'commit_history': 'git log --oneline --since="1 year ago"',
        'readme_files': 'All README.md files across your repos',
        'code_comments': 'Meaningful docstrings and code comments',
        'architecture_docs': 'Technical decision documentation'
    }

# Example extraction result
github_knowledge = """
CODE CHANGE: Implemented multi-stage Docker build optimization
TECHNICAL REASONING: "Reduced container size from 794MB to 686MB using 
build-time dependency optimization and layer caching. This was critical 
for AWS Lambda cold start performance which was hitting 5-6 second delays."

SKILLS DEMONSTRATED: 
- Performance optimization mindset
- AWS Lambda expertise  
- Docker containerization
- Cost-conscious architecture decisions
"""
```

**Sources to mine:**
- Your astro-bento project structure and decisions
- Backend chatbot architecture choices
- Terraform/OpenTofu infrastructure decisions
- Any other public repositories

### 2. Technical Decision Documentation
Create structured decision records from your existing projects:

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Record: Vector Storage Choice

## Context
Personal portfolio chatbot needs semantic search capabilities with minimal operational costs.

## Decision
Embedded FAISS index deployed with Lambda container vs external vector database.

## Rationale
- Cost: $0 vs $20-50/month for Pinecone
- Traffic: Low/intermittent usage pattern  
- Complexity: Simpler deployment pipeline
- Trade-offs: Accept cold start latency for cost savings

## Consequences
- 5-6 second cold starts (acceptable for demo use case)
- Container size increases (mitigated with multi-stage builds)
- No cross-application vector sharing (not needed for personal portfolio)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Technical trade-off evaluation  
- Architecture decision documentation
- Performance vs cost optimization
```

### 3. Professional Skills Documentation
Transform your work experiences into structured examples:

```markdown
# Leadership Example: Technical Debt Management

## Situation
Leading 8-person development team at Wells Fargo while migrating legacy Java applications 
to modern architecture.

## Challenge  
Balancing technical debt reduction with aggressive feature delivery timelines and 
maintaining team morale during high-pressure periods.

## Approach
1. **Structured Process**: Implemented "tech debt Friday" - 20% of sprint capacity 
   dedicated to refactoring and improvements
2. **Team Standards**: Established cross-team code review standards and documentation requirements
3. **Cultural Change**: Created documentation-first culture with knowledge sharing sessions

## Results
- 40% reduction in production bugs over 6 months
- 25% faster onboarding time for new team members
- Maintained 100% sprint commitment rate despite increased code quality focus
- Team satisfaction scores improved from 6.2 to 8.1

## Skills Demonstrated
- Technical leadership
- Process improvement
- Stakeholder communication
- Change management
- Team motivation during challenging transitions
```

### 4. Q&A Pairs from Learning Experiences
Create structured Q&A from your technical explorations:

```python
learning_qa_pairs = [
    {
        'question': 'How do you handle AWS Lambda cold starts with large containers?',
        'answer': 'Multi-stage Docker builds for dependency optimization, consider AWS App Runner for always-on scenarios, and implement health check endpoints for faster warm-up. In my chatbot project, I reduced container size 13.6% through build optimization.',
        'context': 'Real deployment optimization experience',
        'skills': ['aws', 'docker', 'performance-optimization']
    },
    {
        'question': 'When would you choose OpenTofu over Terraform?',
        'answer': 'When you need open-source guarantees and want to avoid vendor lock-in risk. I made this switch mid-project when Terraform licensing changed - required migration planning but ensured long-term project sustainability.',
        'context': 'Practical technology migration decision',
        'skills': ['infrastructure-as-code', 'risk-management', 'technology-evaluation']
    },
    {
        'question': 'How do you approach debugging production issues in distributed systems?',
        'answer': 'Systematic approach: 1) Check monitoring dashboards for patterns, 2) Trace request flows through logs, 3) Isolate failing components, 4) Implement gradual fixes with rollback plans. Document root cause for future prevention.',
        'context': 'Wells Fargo production support experience',
        'skills': ['debugging', 'distributed-systems', 'incident-management']
    }
]
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: GitHub Knowledge Mining

#### Step 1: Update content_ingest.py
```python
# Add GitHub repository scanning
def scan_github_projects():
    """Scan local project directories for knowledge extraction"""
    project_dirs = [
        '../../',  # Current astro project
        # Add paths to other local projects if available
    ]
    
    knowledge_sources = []
    for project_dir in project_dirs:
        # Extract README files
        readme_path = os.path.join(project_dir, 'README.md')
        if os.path.exists(readme_path):
            knowledge_sources.append(extract_project_knowledge(readme_path))
        
        # Extract meaningful commit messages
        try:
            commit_knowledge = extract_commit_history(project_dir)
            knowledge_sources.extend(commit_knowledge)
        except:
            pass  # Skip if not a git repo
    
    return knowledge_sources

def extract_meaningful_commits(project_dir):
    """Extract commits with substantial technical information"""
    meaningful_patterns = [
        'implement', 'refactor', 'optimize', 'migrate', 
        'solve', 'debug', 'enhance', 'architect', 'design'
    ]
    
    # Use git log to extract commits with meaningful messages
    # Filter for commits that demonstrate technical decision-making
```

#### Step 2: Add Multi-Modal Document Types
```python
# Enhanced document metadata
document_types = {
    'code_explanation': 'Code changes with technical reasoning',
    'architecture_decision': 'Technical choices and trade-offs',
    'leadership_example': 'Team management and process improvement',
    'problem_solving': 'Debugging and issue resolution stories',
    'learning_experience': 'Technology evaluation and adoption'
}

# Example document creation
def create_multi_modal_document(content, doc_type, skills, context):
    return Document(
        page_content=content,
        metadata={
            'document_type': doc_type,
            'skills_demonstrated': skills,
            'experience_context': context,
            'verified_outcome': True,
            'professional_relevance': 'high'
        }
    )
```

### Phase 2: Structured Content Creation

#### Create New Content Directories
```bash
mkdir -p src/content/decisions        # Technical decision records
mkdir -p src/content/leadership       # Management and team leadership examples  
mkdir -p src/content/technical-stories # Problem-solving narratives
mkdir -p src/content/learning         # Technology evaluation and adoption stories
```

def generate_multi_modal_response(question, context_docs):
    """Generate responses that draw from multiple knowledge types"""
    
    # Categorize context documents by type
    response_context = {
        'technical_examples': filter_by_type(context_docs, 'code_explanation'),
        'leadership_stories': filter_by_type(context_docs, 'leadership_example'),
        'decision_records': filter_by_type(context_docs, 'architecture_decision'),
        'problem_solving': filter_by_type(context_docs, 'problem_solving')
    }
    
    # Create rich, multi-dimensional responses
    prompt_template = """
